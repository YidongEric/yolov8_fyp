# FYP project code space
## Introduction

This is for WANG's Final year project. We used 3 different algorithms to find the most suitable algorithm for strawberry detection tasks. There are: Yolov8 (The most comprehensive one), Faster R-CNN and Retinanet.

## Explain

- `yolov8` contains files about implementation of YOLOv8
- `fasterrcnn` contains files about implementation of Faster R-CNN
- `retinanet` contains files about implementation of Retinanet

- `Strawberry_dataset` has all the strawberry pictures used in this project
- `FYP_report` contains all the original resources used to finish this report
- `Demo` includes footage showcasing the application of YOLOv8 in camera & robotic arms.

## Demo
I uploaded 2 videos to Youtube to demontrate the model's performance and its potential to apply on robotic arms.
Please see the below two link for demo video:
