# Training YoloV8 on multiclass custom dataset
## 1. Introduction

This is for WANG's Final year project. We aim to use YoloV8 to get a customized model for strawberry detection
 
I have intergrated everything in the .ipynb file, simply run on Google Colab and you will get the result as I did.
The structure is coded as follows:

 ## 2. Installations
 ### 2.1 Prerequisites
  - Python 3
  - Numpy 
  - PyTorch 1.8.1
  - torchvision
  - Pandas
  - Opencv (cv2)

### 2.2 Code-Preparing

```bash
git clone "this git"
```

## 3. Dataset
This dataset contains images of strawberries in different shapes.

The strawberry_dataset containds train folder, valication folder, train.csv and validation.csv
```bash
cards_datset/
 train/
   [xxx].jpg
   ...
 validation/
   [xxx].jpg
   ...
 train.csv
 validation.csv
```
